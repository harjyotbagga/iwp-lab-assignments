      <u>Rich Dad, Poor Dad.</u> By: <u>Robert Kiyosaki</u><br>
      Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his <b><i>best</i></b> friend, his <b><i>rich</i></b> dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a <b><i>high</i></b> income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you. The book is successful in <b><i>beautifully</i></b> describing so.
